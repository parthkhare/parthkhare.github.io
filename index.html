        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Parth!</h1>
        		<h2>Data Musings </h2>
        		        <p> The recent brouhaha over Big Data and Pattern (read Data) Sciences distracts us from tracing it's
        		        genesis, emnating from our subconcious. Remember and try to think the common cord between
        		        the last book on Sherlock Holmes or the last movie on an alien invasion or a National Geography
        		        piece of gladiatorial struggle between a snake and mongoose. 
        		        It is only after a string of high profile murders that Doyle's invulnerable suspect leaves a clue
        		        to help Holmes create a pattern. It's only after the nerd protagonist has tried permutations of armheads 
        		        on different parts of the alien exoskeleton that he/she finds a literal chink in the armor. Similarily,
        		        it takes the mongoose couple of hits before it accurately gauges speed and mobility of the snake. 
        		        All these calculated assessment or patterns are not much different from the estimated probabilties 
        		        of lab experiments. 

        		        <p> A repeated event creates a pattern and a minute iterated observation of patterns is what inculcates 
        		        learning. We have evolved ourselves by doing this subliminal process of observing, learning
        		        and taking actions. During pre-historic ages we feared natural catastrophes (since we did not know what caused them)
        		        and attributed ignorance of it's causes by mapping unique pagan gods to each type of natural disaster. 
        		        Now there exists a specialized insurance product with enumerable exposure for each natural catastrohy.
        		        The entire sentient spectrum higlights how we percieved and acted upon patterns as changes in form of 
        		        interpretation. 
        		        Even the most of intricate algorithms applied to unearth patterns are not completely new. 
        		        Base logic for many machine learning algorithms (neural network, decision trees) are predicated
        		        on a common foundation of fine-tuned recursive learning. 
        		        
        		        <p> So if perceptional Data Sciences has existed as a part of our psyche then what is the new data ?
        		        In dearth of a universal defintion of Big Data, on simple deconstrcution Big Data should simply
        		        more number of rows and columns. And that is precisely what is different about Data Sciences as
        		        being evolved today. I think it's only now that we can layer and condense multiple sources of 
        		        information on single event, transaction or individual together. It's like having multiple perspectives
        		        on the same event only in the case of data they get harmoniously alligned to serve an objective.

        		        <p> The intent of this page is not unimaginatively different from the other blogs/io pages which 
        		        I believe all subscribe of an overarching idea of creating infomration symmetry and reduce time for
        		        learning new skills and techniques and produce more works of scholarship benefitial to the society.
